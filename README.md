# Picker Wheel

A simple and fun tool to make random decisions easier! Built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, the Picker Wheel allows users to add their own options, spin the wheel, and let fate decide. Perfect for games, activities, or when you just canâ€™t make up your mind.

## Features

- **Add/Edit Options**: Easily add or modify the options you want to include in the wheel.
- **Smooth Spin**: Watch the wheel spin with a smooth animation before it stops on a random option.
- **Customizable**: Change the look and feel of the wheel with colors, themes, and spin duration.
- **Browser-Based**: Fully accessible from any modern browser with no installation required.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For the structure of the page and the wheel.
- **CSS**: For styling the page and making the wheel visually appealing.
- **JavaScript**: For the functionality, like adding options and spinning the wheel.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository or download the ZIP file.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.
3. Customize the wheel by adding your own options and clicking the **Spin** button to see the result!

## Future Enhancements

- **Responsiveness**: Currently, the wheel is optimized for desktop-sized screens. In the future, I will make it fully responsive for better performance on various screen sizes (mobile, tablet, etc.).
- **Sound Effects**: Add fun sound effects to enhance the user experience when the wheel spins.
- **Multiple Wheels**: Support for creating multiple wheels on the same page for different activities.
